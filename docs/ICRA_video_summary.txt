This supplementary video summarizes project motivation and method, and contains simulations demonstrating our hybrid planning algorithm. The simulations first compare the hybrid algorithm against a baseline Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search approach. Then, two additional videos showcase our method's robustness to environmental disturbances through robot failures and new tasks.
